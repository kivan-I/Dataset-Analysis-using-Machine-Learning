In this project, the objective is to perform sentiment analysis on a retail dataset containing customer reviews of various clothing products. The main goal is to predict the sentiment expressed in the reviews, which can be positive or negative. The dataset used for this assignment contains information about clothing products, including their Clothing ID, Age of the reviewer, Title and Text of the review etc. You can access the dataset via the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews. To perform sentiment analysis and handle the dataset, several tools and technologies have been employed. The data is stored and managed using MongoDB, a NoSQL database, which allows efficient retrieval and storage of structured information. Python, for data analysis and NLP tasks, is utilized to implement the sentiment analysis algorithms and interact with the MongoDB database. By combining these tools and technologies, the assignment aims to derive valuable insights from customer reviews, helping retailers make data-driven decisions to improve customer satisfaction and enhance product offerings.
